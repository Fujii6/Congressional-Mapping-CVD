The Congressional Template initiative aims to deliver personalized maps of heart disease and stroke death rates to congressional members, providing detailed county-level data within their respective districts. Leveraging the capabilities of R programming, I successfully engineered 1305 customized congressional maps. This streamlined approach ensures each House member gains insights into stroke and heart disease mortality rates specific to their district.

To efficiently address the considerable number of congressional districts in the United States, a comprehensive code was developed, enhancing the production process. These congressional district maps have been integrated into our communications department's workflow who has disseminated these maps to policymakers and division partners, strategically utilizing them to underscore internal disparities across counties within each congressional district. The primary utility of these maps lies in their capacity to illuminate regional variations in health outcomes. By employing this data-driven tool, policymakers gain a nuanced understanding of the health challenges within their district, facilitating informed decisionmaking and targeted interventions.
